# FizzBuzz in Every Language

Welcome to my **FizzBuzz in Every Language** repository! This is a personal project where I implement the classic FizzBuzz problem in every programming language I know or am learning. The goal is to explore different syntaxes, paradigms, and best practices across languages while having fun with a simple yet iconic programming challenge.

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem often used in interviews to assess basic coding skills. The task is simple:

- Print numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of 3, print **"Fizz"** instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print **"Buzz"** instead of the number.
- For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print **"FizzBuzz"**.

## Languages Included

Below is a list of programming languages in which I've implemented FizzBuzz. Click on the language name to view the corresponding code.

- [Python](/python/fizzbuzz.py)
- [JavaScript](/javascript/fizzbuzz.js)
- [Java](/java/FizzBuzz.java)
- [C](/c/fizzbuzz.c)
- [Rust](/rust/fizzbuzz.rs)
- [Swift](/swift/FizzBuzz.swift)
- [Bash](/bash/fizzbuzz.sh)
- [TypeScript](/typescript/fizzbuzz.ts)

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute by adding FizzBuzz implementations in other languages or improving existing ones, feel free to open a pull request! Please ensure your code follows the same structure and style as the existing implementations.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Add your implementation in the appropriate language folder.
4. Update the **Languages Included** section in this README.
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
